# AIA V2.00.1 - Dimensional Reflex Logging Upgrade
# ==================================================
# Delta Phase Warthog - March 12, 2026
#
# What this does:
#   Upgrades the reflex log structure to include color_plane + frequency.
#   This makes ALL corrections happen in dimensional space - not flat scalar.
#
# Before (V1 reflex log entry):
#   {"reflex": "curiosity_reflex", "timestamp": "..."}
#
# After (V2 reflex log entry):
#   {
#     "reflex": "curiosity_reflex",
#     "color_plane": [255, 140, 0],    # RGB - the frequency plane this fired in
#     "frequency": 520.0,              # Hz - position in that plane
#     "hue_shift": +3.2,               # how far from center of that color plane
#     "q_state": 1,                    # WHITE=+1 (fired in superposition)
#     "timestamp": "..."
#   }
#
# Why this matters:
#   Without color_plane: correction engine applies flat scalar to ALL planes equally
#   With color_plane:    correction engine corrects ONLY the plane that drifted
#   
#   Example:
#     curiosity_reflex drifts in the ORANGE plane (freq 520)
#     V1 corrects: ALL curiosity weight reduced by -drift x 0.5
#     V2 corrects: ONLY orange plane curiosity weight reduced
#     
#     Blue plane curiosity (calm/analytical) stays untouched.
#     That's the difference between a flat response and a dimensional one.
#
# HOW TO DEPLOY:
#   Step 1: Run this script - it upgrades existing log entries
#   Step 2: Replace the 5 log functions in your scripts with the ones below
#   Step 3: That's it. The rest of the pipeline reads the same structure.

# -- Color plane registry ------------------------------------------------------

# These are the base assignments - they can be extended.
# The hue_shift moves +- from the center of each plane.

# than the same reflex firing in BLUE space.
